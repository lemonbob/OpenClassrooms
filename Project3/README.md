**Assignment**

In this project, you'll be using your HTML and CSS knowledge to build your first static site from scratch! You'll be creating a website for a person in your community who wants to launch an endeavor but isn't a coder themselves. 

As a developer, you'll often have the chance to be involved in cool projects by building websites for interesting and unique clients!

Let's meet the client. Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organizer of this yearâ€™s Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people. ðŸŒ‰

She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea!

Jennifer has a budget of $3,500 to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations!

Here's what she says:

>My company, "Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival" just got the approval to show movies at Brooklyn Bridge Park this year from August 5th >through 8th, from 6pm to midnight. We can't wait to help the public discover awesome films!
>
>I need to publicize the festival, and to do this, I need a website. On this site, I need to display information about the festival, the >films we're showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival.
>
>There should also be links to the city of Brooklynâ€™s news website, the Brooklyn Bridge Parkâ€™s website, and our Twitter, Instagram, and >Facebook accounts somewhere on the page (navigation bar, footer links, etc). Since I haven't created these accounts yet, you can just >have each social media icon as a link to its homepage (ex. https://twitter.com). 
>
>Shows will be free and open to everyone, but I want people to be able to pre-register so that I'm able to estimate how many people >might come and so that we can close registration if it reaches the venueâ€™s capacity of 5,000 people.
>
>I'd like to have a professional web address, either a .com or .org -- you decide, but just make sure it's relevant to the film festival.


**Project to-dos**

**1. Website prototype**

You'll need to make a first version of the site that meets all the requirements Jennifer explained above. The website prototype should be in HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. You don't actually need to buy the .com or the .org though; you can simply propose it in your project brief.

The pre-registration page doesn't need to be functional. It should be a simple page with a form that doesn't actually submit data to a real codebase.

The webpage you build can be a local set of HTML and CSS files on your computer. There's no need to host or deploy the site.

Make the HTML/CSS site and project brief as aesthetically pleasing as possible! Pay attention to detail, and communicate a sense of brand identity through your font, color, image, and sizing choices. Creating this brand identity is up to you -- however you interpret the film festival itself. 


**2. Project brief**

Make your communication with the client easier by writing a document that puts you both on the same page! ðŸ™Œ In it, you'll cover logistical details about the overall project as well as technical details about the website you create.

Create a project brief from the description above and the clientâ€™s requests. It must have the following elements:

Summary
Stakeholders
Goals
Budget
Timeline
Technical specifications (explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they're basic)

**Presentation**

You'll do an oral presentation of your project with a validator in order to imitate real-life conditions. Your validator, in this case, will play the role of a client. 

The presentation will be structured as follows:  

Presentation of your project brief and site prototype: 15-20 minutes
Q&A: 10 minutes
The validator will stop playing the client for 5 minutes towards the end so that you can do a debrief together.

**Submit**
A project brief explaining your client's needs, including an explanation of the technologies you chose and why
Your HTML and CSS source code (plus other files if necessary)
Note: if you started this project before July 18th, there were no budget nor capacity requirements for the project. Feel free to continue without integrating them. 

**Skills**
Write a project brief
Choose an appropriate technical solution
Detail project specifications
List functionalities requested by the client
